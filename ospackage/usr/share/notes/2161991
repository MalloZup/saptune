#
# The default I/O scheduler for SLES is CFQ. It offers satisfactory performance
# for wide range of I/O task, however choosing an alternative scheduler may 
# potentially yield better latency characteristics and throughput. 
# "noop" is an alternative scheduler, in comparison to CFQ it may offer more 
# consistent performance, lower computation overhead, and potentially higher 
# throughput.
#
# When set, all block devices on the system will be switched to the chosen 
# scheduler.
